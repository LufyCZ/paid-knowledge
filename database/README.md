## Database Structure

### Tables Overview:

- **bounty_forms**: Main form metadata (name, dates, rewards, etc.)
- **form_questions**: Individual questions with their types and options
- **form_responses**: User submissions to forms
- **question_answers**: Individual answers within each submission

### Key Features:

- ✅ **UUID Primary Keys** for security
- ✅ **Foreign Key Constraints** for data integrity
- ✅ **Check Constraints** for data validation
- ✅ **Indexes** for query performance
- ✅ **Row Level Security** for access control
- ✅ **Auto-updated timestamps**
- ✅ **Cascading deletes** to prevent orphaned data

## Security Notes - TODO

- The current RLS policies allow all operations for development
- In production, you should:
  - Implement proper user authentication
  - Restrict form creation to authenticated users
  - Allow only form owners to edit their forms
  - Control who can view private forms

## Next Steps - TODO

- [ ] Add user authentication (Supabase Auth)
- [ ] Implement form sharing and permissions
- [ ] Add file upload for images/videos (Supabase Storage)
- [ ] Create an admin dashboard for form management
- [ ] Add form analytics and response viewing
- [ ] Integrate with payment systems for rewards
